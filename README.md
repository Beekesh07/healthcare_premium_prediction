Healthcare Premium Prediction
Project Description
The Healthcare Premium Prediction project is a web application built using Streamlit, designed to predict the healthcare insurance cost for an individual based on various factors such as age, gender, smoking status, BMI, insurance plan, medical history, and more. This tool provides users with an easy interface to input their details and get an estimated health insurance premium based on the given data.

Technologies Used
Python: The main programming language for the application.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical operations and handling arrays.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning and model training.
Joblib: For saving and loading the trained model.
Streamlit: For building the web interface.
PyCharm: The IDE used for development.
Jupyter Notebook: For exploratory data analysis (EDA) and experimentation.
EDA: To perform exploratory data analysis on the dataset.
Stats: Statistical analysis for understanding data patterns.
Features
User Input: Allows users to input details such as:
Age
Gender
Number of dependents
Income
Smoking status
BMI category
Employment status
Insurance plan
Region
Medical history
Prediction: The model calculates the health insurance premium based on the inputs provided.
